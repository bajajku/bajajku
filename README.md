## 🧠 About Me

I'm a developer who loves turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. Whether it's building scalable mobile apps, crafting AI chatbots, or optimizing backend systems, I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to make things better.

Outside of tech, I think like a philosopher and play like an athlete. I’m drawn to ideas, challenges, and collaboration. I believe in meaningful technology—tools that make life easier, fairer, and more human.
